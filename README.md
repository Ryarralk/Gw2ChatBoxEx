# Gw2 - ChatBoxEx

Gw2 - ChatBoxEx offers the possibility of exceeding the limit of 199 characters in the chat box for Guild Wars 2. 

## Installation

You can put the executable anywhere on your computer, it will run fine.

## Running

Make sure that Guild Wars 2 is launched when you are running the ChatBoxEx. The program will end automatically when you close the game.

## Instructions

First of all :

DO NOT MOVE AND DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE THAT REQUIRES YOUR KEYBOARD WHILE IT IS TYPING !

This is literally emulating your keyboard. If you move or quit the chat box before it finishes to type, the application will keep typing until all is done or until it is stopped.
You can still use your mouse at the same time to move, but it's at your own risk if you miss your move and disable the chat box.

Here's the different commands you can use with the application :

- SHIFT + ENTER : Open the enhanced chat box. You can type as much character as you want (If can goes up to 2 billions characters). The chat box support copy-paste and multiline, but it's not perfect for the moment and you could be temporary muted by the chat.

- ESC : Quit the enhanced chat box but not the application.

- SHIFT + ESC : Quit the application. A little sound will confirm that it's closed. I recommend you to use this method instead of closing it via the Task Bar due to the fact that is must close some a DLL file before stopping terminating itself.

- SHIFT + BACKSPACE : Stop the writing process. A sound will inform you that you can open a new chat box. Don't try to open a new chat box until you hear the sound.
